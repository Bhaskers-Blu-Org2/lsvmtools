LSVMTools
=========

Overview
--------

The LSVMTools project provides tools for shielding Linux VMs operating
in the Microsoft(R) Windows Hyper-V environment. LSVMTools aims to protect
Linux VMs from attack while at rest and in flight. It builds on the following
technologies.

- Windows Server 2016 Guarded Fabric
- Hyper-V Shielded VMs
- UEFI
- TPM 2.0
- Linux Unified Key Setup (LUKS)
- dm-crypt

LSVMTools provides two main tools.

- **LSVMPREP** - Prepares the image for shielding
- **LSVMLOAD** - The primary boot loader for the image

### LSVMPREP

**LVSMPREP** prepares the Linux enviroment for shielding. After the image
is prepared, it must be templatized and provisioned as described in the
[LSVM How-To](doc/LSVM_How_To.pdf) document. LSVMPREP performs the following
steps.

- Encrypts the boot partition with a well-known passphrase
- Patches the system to automatically mount the encyrpted boot parition
- Installs LSVMLOAD on the EFI System Partition (ESP)
- TPM-seals the passphrases and stores them on the ESP
- Copies the SHIM and GRUB2 to the encrypted boot partition
- Patches the initial ramdisk configuration to get passphrases non-interactively
- Regenerates the initial ramdisks and GRUB2 configuration
- Applies any UEFI dbx updates (for black-listed boot loaders)

After these steps are performed, the image is ready to be templatized. See
the [LSVM How-To](doc/LSVM_How_To.pdf) document for details.

### LSVMLOAD

**LSVMLOAD** becomes the primary EFI boot loader for the Linux VM. UEFI loads
LSVMLOAD, assuming it passes certificate verification (**LSVMLOAD** must be
signed by a certificate that Hyper-V trusts). **LSVMLOAD** performs the 
following steps.

- Uses TPM to unseal a **keyfile** (containing the disk partition passphrases)
- Maps the ESP onto an **ESP ramdisk**
- Maps the encrypted boot partition onto an unencrypted **boot ramdisk**
- Patches the initial ramdisk with the **keyfile** (on the boot ramdisk)
- Loads the Linux SHIM from the **boot ramdisk**
- Launches the SHIM, which is redirected to the **ESP ramdisk**

The SHIM finds GRUB2 on the **ESP ramdisk** (copied from the encrypted boot
partition by LSVMLOAD). The SHIM executes GRUB2, which is redirected to the
**boot ramdisk**, where it finds:

- A patched GRUB2 configuration file
- A patched initial ramdisk (patched by LSVMLOAD with the **keyfile**)
- The Linux kernel

GRUB2 executes the kernel and the initial ramdisk. The initial ramdisk mounts
the boot and root partitions using the **keyfile** injected by LSVMLOAD.

LSVMLOAD works using unmodified SHIM and GRUB2 executables, making it
possible to configure a Linux environment for shielding without having
to change any programs along the boot chain.

Installing
----------

This section explains how to install from a binary distribution. Binary 
distributions can be found here:

[Binary Distributions](binaries)

These distributions include **LSVMPREP** and a signed **LSVMLOAD**.

Use the following commands to install the distibution.

```
# tar zxvf lsvmtools-1.0.0-x86_64.tar.gz
# cd lsvmtools-1.0.0-x86_64
# ./install
```

This installs LSVMTools here:

```
/opt/lsvmtools-1.0.0
```

Running LSVMPREP
----------------

**Caution: Running LSVMPREP may render a Linux system unusable, so only
run LSVMPREP for the purposes of creating an image for templatization.**

To run LSVMPREP, execute the following commands as root.

```
# cd /opt/lsvmtools-1.0.0
# ./lsvmprep
```

If LSVMPREP runs successfully, the image is ready to be templatized. See
[LSVM How-To](doc/LSVM_How_To.pdf) for details.

Building
--------

This section explains how to build LSVMTools from source, but note that 
LSVMPREP requires a signed LSVMLOAD image. This component must be downloaded 
separately (see the previous section for details).

To build LSVMTools, type these commands.

```
# ./configure
# make
```

This builds LSVMPREP and an unsigned LSVMLOAD.
